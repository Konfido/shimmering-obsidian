A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Relevant Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots and/or a screen recording to help explain your problem.

**Is the Problem related to Obsidian 0.13+ / Live Preview Mode?**
It is extremely helpful to know whether the issue occurred due to Obsidian's new Live Preview feature introduced in version 0.13+. To test this, go the the Obsidian settings and turn on `Use Legacy Editor`. Please report here whether the bug you are encountering still occurs or does not occur anymore when using the Legacy Editor.

**Debugging Log**
You can get a debugging log by opening the workflow in Alfred preferences and pressing cmd + D. A small window will open up which will log everything happening during the execution of the Workflow. Use the malfunctioning part of the workflow once more, copy the content of the log window, and attach it as text file.
