## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
When updating from version 1.x to version 2.x, there are some breaking changes for certain commands. Most importantly, this plugin now requires the [Metadata Extractor Plugin](https://github.com/kometenstaub/metadata-extractor) to run most of its features.

Please refer to [the Breaking Changes Docs](documentation/Breaking%20Changes.md) for more in-detail information.
