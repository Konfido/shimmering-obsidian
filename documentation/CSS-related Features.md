# CSS-related Features

## Open & Create your CSS Files
**`ocss`: Access your [css] files.**
- Open a theme or CSS snippet in your default text editor.
- Open the “themes” or “snippets” folder located in `.obsidian` in Finder.
- Create a **new CSS snippet** in mere seconds: The CSS file will be placed in your snippet folder, filled with your clipboard content, named after the query you enter after `ocss`, and then opened in your default text editor. Furthermore, this will open the Obsidian Settings in the background, to save you yet another click. 🙂

## Theme Search
➡️ Refer to the [Plugin & Theme Search](documentation/Plugin%20and%20Theme%20Search.md#Themes) for information on the theme search capabilities.
- Useful for 🎨 theme designers will be the `fn + return` command to quickly download any theme's CSS.

## 🎨 For Theme Designers: Cheatsheet
**`ocheat`: Quickly Access Various Cheatsheets for designing themes in Obsidian.**
- The cheatsheets will be opened via the macOS Quick Look feature, so you can simply close them by pressing `space`.

## 🎨 For Theme Designers: Quick Font File Conversion
**`Triggered via Universal Action`: Convert a font file to CSS with base64.**
- This will take the selected font file (e.g., `.tff` or `.woff`), convert them into base64 and write the base64-encoded font into a CSS file, which will be placed into your snippets folder.
- See the Alfred Documentation for how to use [Universal Actions](https://www.alfredapp.com/universal-actions/).
