# Settings Search
*🆕 version 2.1*

**`o,`: Search and open settings.**
- The search includes Obsidian main settings as well as settings for plugins.
- The search smartly matches also the content of the respective settings tabs, e.g. the query `o, readabable line` will show the Editor Settings, since the "Readable line length" option can be found there.
- Press `↵`to open the respective setting **directly**. [^1]
- `⌥ + ↵` will open the local folder of the plugin in Finder.
