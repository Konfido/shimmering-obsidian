# Breaking Changes

## New Features in version 2.0
The features new to version 2.0 are listed in the [Feature Overview section of the README](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-obsidian/blob/main/README.md#feature-overview) with a üÜï emoji.

## New Requirement
‚ö†Ô∏è __The [Metadata Extractor Plugin](https://github.com/kometenstaub/metadata-extractor) is now a hard requirement that needs to be installed ‚Äî without it, you will not be able to use this plugin anymore.__ The plugin allows Alfred to access various internal data like tags, aliases, and headings which third-party apps normally would not be able to do. (It also greatly increases the speed of this workflow!)

‚ùóÔ∏è After installation, you need to create the metadata once before you can use the Alfred-based Quick Switcher: Run `opdate ‚Üí Manually Refresh Metadata` to do so.

## Metadata Extractor Configuration
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Do not change any of the default values how the metadata extractor names its output files and where they are placed ‚Äî otherwise this workflow won't be able to find them.**
- The setting _should_ change is the one regarding the automatic refreshing of the metadata files. The higher the frequency, the more accurate the Quick Switcher of this Alfred workflow will become.

## List of all other Breaking Changes 
*when updating from v. 1.x to 2.x*
- the previous `ot` command to open the current theme has been **removed** to avoid overlap with the new tag search ‚Äì the command id now called via the `ocss` command.
- the previous `otrash` command to open the current theme has been renamed to `o.`, to avoid crowding the `ot` keyword. For consistency, and simplicity, `o.obsidian` is now also accessible via `o.`
- keyword `odefault` replaced with `ocheat`
- forum search renamed to `of` because `oh` became too crowded
- `Open in Dualmode` modifier for the `o` search is removed for now, as Alfred only allows for 5 modifiers per action.
- `osettings` keyword *for updating the documentation search* has been renamed `oupdate` for consistency.
- Attachment search removed for now, as it would crowd the now enhanced main search too much. If there is demand for it, I will implement a new, separate attachment search. [Please create a GitHub issue if you are interested in this.](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-obsidian)
- removed CSS Snippet toggling, as there are now [multiple](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/MySnippets-Plugin) [plugins](https://github.com/deathau/snippet-commands-obsidian) that do that better
- removed hotkey for font-base64-conversion for decluttering. (You can still set one of your own, if you want to!)

*when updating to 2.1*
- removed `osettings` command ‚Äì improved version now available via the command `o,`. See [Settings-Search](Settings%20Search.md).

*when updating to 2.3*
- replaced `ovault` command with `ov`. See [Vault Switcher documentation](Vault%20Switcher.md).
- removed `ofreq` for simplification, still available via `oupdate ‚Üí Set Metadata Update Frequency`
