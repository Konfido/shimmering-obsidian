# Documentation Search

## Documentation & Hub
**`oh`: Get `h`elp by searching the official [Obsidian documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Start+here) and the [Obsidian Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub).**
- This command mimics the search behavior on the official documentation site, meaning that it also searches for headings inside individual documentation pages.
	- Press `return` to open in your default browser.
	- Use `opt + return` to copy the link to your clipboard instead.
- After major updates of the Obsidian documentation, this Alfred workflow needs to recreate its index of the Obsidian documentation. You can do so by selecting the respective option when typing keyword `oupdate`. (Index recreation can take a few seconds depending on your internet connection. You will be notified when it is done.)
